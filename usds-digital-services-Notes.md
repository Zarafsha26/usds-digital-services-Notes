## 🔢 The 13 Plays (Simplified)

### 1. 🧠 Understand What People Need  
Talk to real users early and often. Find out their needs and test solutions with them.

### 2. 🔄 Address the Full Experience  
Look at all the ways people interact with the service — online, in person, or by phone — and make every part smooth.

### 3. ✨ Make It Simple and Intuitive  
Use plain language and clear design. People should succeed the first time, without help.

### 4. 🚀 Build in Small Steps (Agile)  
Launch a basic version (MVP) within 3 months. Iterate based on feedback and learning.

### 5. 💰 Structure Budgets & Contracts for Flexibility  
Ensure contracts support user research, testing, and changes — not just big deliverables.

### 6. 👤 Assign One Accountable Leader  
Give one person full responsibility and authority to manage the product and make decisions.

### 7. 👥 Bring In Experienced Teams  
Use skilled professionals — designers, developers, and product managers — who have built real digital products.

### 8. ⚙️ Use Modern Technology  
Use up-to-date tools and avoid vendor lock-in. Prefer open-source and cloud solutions.

### 9. ☁️ Host in the Cloud  
Use flexible, scalable hosting that can grow with demand and keep services running reliably.

### 10. 🤖 Automate Testing and Deployment  
Use automated tests and continuous delivery to deploy updates quickly and safely.

### 11. 🔐 Manage Security & Privacy  
Engage legal/privacy/security officers early. Reuse secure components and protect personal data.

### 12. 📊 Use Data to Drive Decisions  
Monitor real-time performance, gather user feedback, and improve based on usage data.

### 13. 🌐 Default to Open  
Share your code, data, and progress publicly (when appropriate) to support reuse and collaboration.
